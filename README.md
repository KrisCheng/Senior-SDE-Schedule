# Senior-SDE-Schedule

### Motivation

I will finish my postgraduate and join [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/cn/) as a software develpoment engineer on 2020, Frankly speaking, I am not satisfied (even very upset) with my personal achievements over the past 6.5 years in Tongji University. The most important problem is that I didnot explore one particular topic deeply. I have done Product Manager, Frontend, Backend, Algorithm, Data etc. I think this is a very good plan for thoes people who are very gifted, but unfortunately I am not one of them obviously (if so, I think I will get much more achievements), even though I am very interested about all of them.

So, it's important for me to make choice right now. In my first stage of career, I want to use about 3 years to testify whether I am suitable for a purely software engineer (usually with this ascent curve, Junior SDE -> Senior SDE -> Development Manager -> Technical Director -> CTO). If so, I think it's enough to become a Senior SDE in this period, if not, I think I have to make other plans to become more successfuly in my career, and this repository is designed to record this process.
